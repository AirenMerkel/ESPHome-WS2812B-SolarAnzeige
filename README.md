# ESPHome-WS2812B-SolarAnzeige
Personal project to create a nice 3d printed display for my solar system.
It is still work in progress.

I used 480 2020 IC RGBs from WÃ¼rth Elektronik  (https://www.we-online.com/de/components/products/WL-ICLED#/articles/WL_ICLED_CHIP_LED_2020)

I designed my own circuit board and ordered it from aisler.net.

I've also printed a frame for it, and the files will be published soon.
